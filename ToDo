1 - Static code analysis for the TestEnv (Lambda function to parse YML)
2 - Pipeline deploys test infrastructure

General flow = Deploy pipeline with CF -> test CF templates (Pass/Fail), pass = deploy infrastructure, fail = don't and return reason.



Extension Tasks
Integrate GNS3 Cisco Router for BGP peering with VPN Gateway
Expand VPC Peering -> Single Hub VPC with multiple spokes


FIX - Cannot ping between 'on-prem' and the EC2 instances or between the peered instances.




IDEA - For Terraform deployment have the TF file saved in S3, deploy EC2 from basic CF template that references the S3 bucket
and runs the TF file that it pulls off S3?
