# Project: Implementation of NetDevOps to a Cloud Environment

## Overview
The project presents an implementation of applying a CI/CD pipeline, taken from the aspects and principles of DevOps, and applying it to a Cloudformation template which contains network-centric infrastrucutre under test: VPC, CIDR blocks, a Site-to-Site VPN through Transit Gateway etc. Although this could be modified and/or extended to also include security aspects such as IAM roles/permission or anything else which is able to be placed into a Cloudformation template. 

The diagram shows the flow of the current implementation.
